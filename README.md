An Interesting Cipher: More on Strings 

This code implements a simple shift cipher, which encodes a given string by shifting each character to the next one in the alphabet. It starts by converting all characters to lowercase for uniformity and compatibility with the alphabet string alpha. As it iterates through each character in the input string s, it finds the index of the character in alpha, adds one to shift to the next character, and then uses modulo 26 to wrap around from z back to a. The shifted characters are then appended to an output string t, which is printed as the final encoded result.

This code demonstrates basic character substitution with a fixed shift value, a foundational concept in classical encryption techniques like Caesar ciphers.
